            I’m a passionate creator. Whether I’m building websites, designing software, or playing guitar, I always strive to express my ideas through whatever I’m working on. I’ve spent the last several years working at Tubi diving into the complexities of streaming video. At Tubi, I've spent time designing frontend features in React, building custom video players and developing APIs and validation tools to keep streams healthy. Outside of work, I chase projects that spark my curiosity: a learning platform for people who are eager to explore the ins and outs of financial markets, web ABR player for testing HLS/DASH playback and a website for sharing free guitar loops. Across everything, I care about making products that are functional but also fun for people to use. I’m always looking for the next challenge to push my skills and ship experiences that genuinely delight people.
